# Joins
This project demonstrates the use of SQL Joins by designing a simple relational database consisting of two tables:
	•	Students → Contains details of students such as Student ID, Name, and the Course they are enrolled in.
	•	Courses → Contains details of courses such as Course ID and Course Name.

The main objective is to show how different types of JOIN operations (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN) can be used to combine data from multiple tables in meaningful ways.

🔹 Key Features:
	•	Database Creation: A database JoinsPractice was created with Students and Courses tables.
	•	Data Insertion: Sample data of students and courses was inserted to simulate a real-world scenario.
	•	JOIN Queries:
	•	INNER JOIN → Shows only students with a valid course assigned.
	•	LEFT JOIN → Displays all students, including those without a registered course.
	•	RIGHT JOIN → Displays all courses, including those without enrolled students.
	•	FULL OUTER JOIN (simulated with UNION in MySQL) → Combines all students and all courses, showing NULL where data is missing.

 🔹 Learning Outcome:

By working on this project, I learned how to:
	•	Create and manage relational databases in MySQL.
	•	Establish relationships between tables using common keys.
	•	Apply different types of JOINs to merge and analyze data effectively.
	•	Understand real-world use cases where joins are crucial (e.g., students–courses, employees–departments, customers–orders).
